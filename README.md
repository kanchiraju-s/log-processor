Sure! Here's a polished GitHub README for your **Log Processing Engine** project:

---

# 🧵 Log Processing Engine (Multithreaded)

A high-performance Java application to parse and analyze large log files concurrently using multithreading and Java Concurrency utilities.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Concurrent processing of multiple `.log` files using `ExecutorService`
* ✅ Real-time progress monitoring via `CountDownLatch`
* ✅ Error aggregation using `ConcurrentHashMap`
* ✅ Generates error report for each file
* ✅ Easily extendable for metrics collection, CSV/JSON output, or streaming logs

## 📁 Project Structure

```
log-processor/
├── LogProcessor.java         // Main class
├── logs/                     // Place your .log files here
```

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java 8+
* `ExecutorService` for thread pooling
* `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe aggregation
* `CountDownLatch` for task coordination
* File I/O with `BufferedReader`

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-processor.git
   cd log-processor
   ```

2. Place your `.log` files inside the `logs/` directory.

3. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   javac LogProcessor.java
   java LogProcessor
   ```

4. Sample Output:

   ```
   Remaining files: 3
   Remaining files: 2
   Remaining files: 1

   --- Error Report ---
   app1.log: 125 errors
   app2.log: 87 errors
   app3.log: 140 errors
   ```

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Imagine analyzing distributed application logs across multiple services. This engine can:

* Aggregate critical error counts
* Monitor processing progress live
* Help DevOps teams triage incidents faster

---

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Output to CSV/JSON
* GUI dashboard
* Log level breakdown (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR)
* Real-time streaming support
